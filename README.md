Java Learning Journey: Structured for organised documentation and progress tracking

# ☕ Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Java learning journey! This repository tracks everything I'm learning — from syntax fundamentals to building full applications using Java and related tools.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand Java syntax and core concepts
- Practice object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Learn exception handling and Java I/O
- (Build console-based and basic GUI applications)
- Get introduced to Java frameworks ( Spring Boot)
- Understand DevOps basics ( CI/CD, testing)
